Hello everyone, I am Hongyu Ge, a student who is currently studying in Shandong University. My major is mathematics but I am really interested in AI. Specifically, my research domain is multimodal large language models. To be honest, I am new in this area so there many things to learn. I will put my codes on github and I welcome your precious suggestions.
